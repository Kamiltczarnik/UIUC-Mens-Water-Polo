          We are a group of men at the University of Illinois who enjoy the sport of
          water polo and the camaraderie of the team. We practice both fall and spring
          semesters with our fall semester acting as our season. During the fall semester,
          we practice 3-4 nights per week and travel to three Big Ten tournaments from
          late September to end of October to compete for the Big Ten Division title.
          The spring semester is our off-season in which we practice about 2 nights a week.
          We also co-host a tournament of our own and travel to a couple tournaments outside
          of the Big Ten.
